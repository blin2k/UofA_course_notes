	80% of data on the internet are videos. They are dark matters if machines can't understand them.

# Representation
## Hubel & Wiesel

1. Input Image
2. Primal Sketch
	1. reduced information
3. 2.5-D Sketch
	1. found discontinuities in depth and in surface
4. 3-D Model Representation

## More Representations
- Generalized Cylinder
- Pictorial Structure

To reduce the complex structure of the object into a collection of simpler shapes and their geometric configuration.

## David Lowe
- Lines and Edges

# Image Segmentation
	Group the pixels into meaningful areas.
- Normalized Cut

# Feature-based Object Recognition
Some features tend to remain diagnostic and invariant to changes.
- SIFT
	- Scale Invariant Feature Transformation
- Hog
	- Histogram of Gradients
- Deformable Part Model

# ImageNet
The best benchmark dataset.

# Convolutional Neural Network
The winning algorithm of ImageNet Challenge 2012, bringing the greatest improvement ever.

AKA Deep Learning or CNN or Convnets

# Object Detection
Rather than classifier the entire image, we want to draw bounding boxes and say there is a something here.

# Image Captioning
Given an image, the system produces a natural language sentence describing the image.
