A filter can be called a Receptive Field. Comparing to W in fully connected layers, filters can feel the local spatial connectivity.

# Pooling Layer

## Max Pooling

It takes the maximum variable in the region

Sliding can reduce the size of the layer as well, but it is expensive.

Pools can overlap each other.

==It is not common to use zero-padding for pooling layers.==

After having several conv layers, use a FC layer to classify the final result.
- No need to keep the spatial connectivity anymore
- FC layer is classifying the most complex features

# Typical Architecture
$[(CONV-RELU)*N-POOL?]*M-(FC-RELU)*K,SOFTMAX$
- N
	- Usually up to ~5
- M
	- Large
- K
	- 0~2

Recent advances such as ResNet / GoogleLeNet challenge this paradigm
